# Kickstarting with excel 

## Overview of project
In this project we are showing you the outcome of Kickstarters in different categories

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to simplify the information and make it easily accessible with charts instead of having to sift through information that is not needed

## Analysis and Challenges 
I realized that the higher success rates correlates with the launch date and also the goal amount a kickstarter used 

### Analysis of outcomes based on launch date
The highest success rate came from May-july whereas the lowest rates were in the beginning of the year and end of the year Graph Located here ![Theater outcomes vs launch Date](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

### Analysis of outcomes based on goals
From my analysis i determined that that goals that had less than 1000 had a higher successful rate while 1000 to 4999 had a bigger quanity of success but had a higher failed rate as well. Also, the higher goal the more higher of a fail rate the Kickstarter outcome would be. ![Outcomes based on goals]

### Challenges and difficulies encountered
My biggest challenges was trying to figure out the difference in outcome based on goals and correlating it with outcomes based on launch date.

## Conclusions

We can conclude that there is a higher success rate when making a kickstarter in the middle of the year rather then the beginning or the end of the year by using the chart in the sheet (Outcomes based on launch) and also there is a higher success rate in making the kickstarter goal as low as possible with a 2:10 ratio of success to failed. Some of the limitations of this dataset that its still not niche enough to get a definite answer. We drew conclusions only from goals and launchdate when there are more things we should be looking at as in demographics and age. We can also create more category graphs from this data and also even more in depth time.
